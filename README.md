# Rocket-League-Goal-Probability

The video game Rocket League is best described as car soccer, where two teams of virtual automobiles compete to score more goals than the opposition. Utilizing the data stored in the Rocket League post-match replay files, I use the momentary game state which contains the player and ball locations and velocities among many other variables to predict who scores the next goal in Rocket League matches. More specifically, the matches used are from the solo game mode at the highest rank, called Supersonic Legend. The model is able to predict the correct goal scoring team about 60 percent of the time, and the percentage of correct predictions skyrockets if only goals that occurred shortly after the given moment are considered. This project reveals that maintaining possession of the ball and controlling boost are among the most effective strategies for a player to implement. It also provides evidence that similar models could be created in real sports when player tracking data becomes more widely available.
