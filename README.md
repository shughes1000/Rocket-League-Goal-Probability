# Rocket-League-Goal-Probability

The video game Rocket League is best described as car soccer, where two teams of virtual automobiles compete to score more goals than the opposition. 

Utilizing the data stored in the Rocket League post-match replay files, I use the momentary game state which contains spatial data, such as the player and ball locations and velocities among many other variables, to predict who scores the next goal in Rocket League matches. 

This project reveals that maintaining possession of the ball and controlling boost (a resource that allows the car to drive faster) are among the most effective strategies for a player to implement. It also provides evidence that similar models could be created in real sports when player tracking data becomes more widely available.
